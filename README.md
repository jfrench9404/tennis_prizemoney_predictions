This utilizes the tennis database to help prospective players choose which tournaments to sign up for that will give them the most success.

In professional tennis, there are many tournaments around the world that you could play in. The biggest question is: which one's do we compete in? Which one's will give me the best chance to succeed and rack in the money prize money?

In a volatile sport, there is no financial security unless you are in the top 5% of players (globally). Historically, unless you were winning a tournament, you couldn't sustain a long career in professional tennis. 90% of the prize pool was dominated by 1% of the player base, with everyone else struggling to scrap together enough prize pool to make it on tour.

The financial breakdown of players is as such (for players ranked outside of the top 200):
- 90% -> prize money
- 10% -> endorsements, sponsorships, benefactors, etc.

There is very little if no sponsorship deals that can feasibly help players (in today's game) that help them generate a beneficial lifestyle. The ESPN article in 2023 points this out, as many players can barely find the funding necessarily to cover costs and travel expenses that stack up at the end of each year.

In recent years, the WTA, ATP, and the 4 majors have partnered together to distribute prize money more evenly across rounds, giving lower ranked players the opportunity to continue to play and compete in the sport they love without being distracted financially. While some could point to sponsors as an option, a bigger reason for winning is to get your name out there for sponsors to recognize you. In 2021, Matteo Berritini made it to the Wimbledon Finals for the first time in his career. Prior to this achievement, he hadn't reached a Semis. This breakthrough has elevated his status in the men's game, giving a fresh look for companies to sponsor travel and cover costs that otherwise would need to be covered by prize money.

In this program, we are going to be looking at which tournaments give men's players an edge in the game. Are there some tournaments where Lucky Losers or Qualifying players have more success in? Are there certain players at a certain rank (ranked 200 or lower [lower meaning 201, 202, etc.]) to determine if there are players in a specific tournament that is playing in it, should you avoid it.

To establish context, each professional tournament holds qualifying rounds prior to the official start date of the tournament. These rounds are used to determine the last remaining open spots on the draw and gives lower ranked players a chance to earn a spot on the draw that otherwise would've been taken up by a higher ranked player. When you see a "qualifying player" or "Q" next to a player's name, that means they won it through the Qualifying Rounds to make it into the Main Draw.

Lucky Losers are essentially "lucky." These are players that lost in the Qualifying Rounds but are chosen by the tournament director and are given a "second chance" to compete in the Main Draw. Maybe it was a bad day?

To simplify our goals further, we will be looking at two questions:

- Are there tournaments that we are favored to win in rather than another?
- Are there players we should avoid playing in a tournament with?

This question will be primarily answered by looking at the amount of break point chances we can face and how hard it is to play our second serve into the opponent. If the player doesn't give many chances and can attack our second serve, we must play perfect. Otherwise, it will be a tough match to win.
  
- Can you predict you're likelihood to win or determine how far you'd go in a tournament based on your rank and court preference?

We will be specifically looking at men's tennis, ATP data on the singles side in order to determine what tournaments are the best for us to compete in.

Since the downward trend of the Big 3 in the men's game, the levels of the players are all over the board. There is no solid favorite to win tournaments or slams like it has over the past 2 decades. If you are looking to get ahead of the pack and get into the big tournaments to get a shot to make history, now is the time. Now, let's see where you should start playing first.

# Other Notes
Tennis data is hard to come by, and data analytics in general is still in its infancy when it comes to the beginning of its time. I hope to continue to improve these models and algorithms to showcase what we can learn from data in the tennis world and encourage others to jump into the stats with me along with sharing the game with others.
